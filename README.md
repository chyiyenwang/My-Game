Approach:
I started with creating my object constructors for the ball and paddle.  After that I worked on the ball movement.  

Unsolved problems:
The collision detection between the paddles and the ball could be better.  Currently, if the ball moves too fast and at certain angles the ball will go through the paddle.  

Another unsolved problem is when the ball goes past the paddles there is a streak that shows until the paddle moves to erase it.

Third, the serve button is not supposed to work after a player wins.
