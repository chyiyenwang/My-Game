# [PONG](http://chyiwang.com/My-Game/)
### About
A front end web app created using the HTML5 Canvas API.  This project was inspired by the Atari game of the same name - Pong.  I have always been and still am a big gamer and I decided to create a video game myself so I thought to myself why not make a game in homage of Pong.

### Unsolved problems
* The collision detection between the paddles and the ball could be better.  Currently, if the ball moves too fast and at certain angles the ball will go through the paddle.  
* Another unsolved problem is when the ball goes past the paddles there is a streak that shows until the paddle moves to erase it.
* Third, the serve button is not supposed to work after a player wins.
